# Covid-19-future-prediction-with-time-series-forecasting-using-prophet-model

Time Series analysis is being widely used in the
fields of corporate sectors, medical sciences, weather forecasting
and stock prices to predict future values based on previously
observed values. In this research, Time Series data of COVID-19
(SARS-CoV-2) obtained from a dataset obtained from
worldometers has been to predict the prognosis of the virus in the
forthcoming days. The dataset contains summed up values of the
daily new cases, recovered cases and deaths from 187 countries
right from the day from which the first case was reported. After
exploring and splitting the data into train and test sets to ensure the
fidelity of the model, a Machine Learning model called Prophet
which was introduced by Facebook has been used to train and test
on the observed data. Finally, it has been used to draw probabilistic
insights for the future on the new cases, recovered cases and new
deaths for the next month
